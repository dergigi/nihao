# nihao TODO

## Setup
- [ ] NIP-05 setup assistance — help users configure `/.well-known/nostr.json` on their domain

## Check
- [ ] Dynamic relay discovery via NIP-66 relay monitors — use relay monitor events to find/recommend relays instead of hardcoded lists

## Ideas
- [ ] `nihao update` — update an existing identity (change name, picture, etc.)
- [x] `nihao backup` — export full identity state (profile, relay list, follows, wallet)
- [ ] `nihao nuke` — publish deletion events for all identity-related kinds
